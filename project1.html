      <b class="movie_name"> Rangasthalam</b> (transl. Stage/Theatre) is a 2018
      Indian Telugu-language action thriller film[3] written and directed by
      Sukumar. Produced by Y. Naveen, Y. Ravi Shankar and C. V. Mohan for the
      company Mythri Movie Makers, the film stars Ram Charan and Samantha with,
      Jagapathi Babu, Naresh, Prakash Raj, Sunil Barve, Aadhi Pinisetty, and
      Anasuya Bharadwaj in key supporting roles. Rangasthalam is set in the
      eponymous fictional village in the 1980s. It narrates the story of two
      brothers, Chittibabu (Charan) and Kumar Babu (Pinisetty) who oppose the
      village's local government and the corrupt co-operative society led by its
      president Phanindra Bhupathi (Babu). Sukumar started working on the film's
      script after completing Nannaku Prematho (2016), and collaborated with R.
      Rathnavelu, who served as the director of photography. Devi Sri Prasad
      composed the film's soundtrack and score; Naveen Nooli edited the film.
      One of the first few Indian films to be entirely shot using Red Helium 8K
      cameras, Rangasthalam's principal photography began in April 2017 with the
      working title RC11 and lasted until March 2018. Majorly filmed in a
      village set worth ₹5 crore erected in Hyderabad, ten percent of the film's
      footage was shot in and around Rajahmundry. The film was made on a budget
      of ₹60 crore, and was released globally on 30 March 2018. Rangasthalam
      received positive reviews from the critics who were particularly
      appreciative of Sukumar's writing and the performances of the ensemble
      cast, especially of Ram Charan and Jagapathi Babu although they criticized
      the length. The film was commercially successful, grossing a total of ₹216
      crore, and become highest-grossing film of Charan's career. It is among
      the highest-grossing Telugu films. It also won the National Film Award for
      Best Audiography. A Kannada-dubbed version of the film titled Rangasthala
      was released on 12 July 2019. The film is considered one of the "25
      Greatest Telugu Films Of The Decade" by Film Companion.[4] It also won the
      state Gaddar Award for Second Best Feature Film.[5]

      Indian Telugu-language epic romantic fantasy action film co-written and
      directed by S. S. Rajamouli, based on a story by V. Vijayendra Prasad.
      Produced by Allu Aravind under Geetha Arts, the film stars Ram Charan,
      Kajal Aggarwal, Dev Gill and Srihari. The film follows a street-bike racer
      who discovers his connection to a 17th-century warrior through
      reincarnation and sets out to rescue his lover from a vengeful adversary
      tied to their past lives. Made on a budget of ₹35–44 crore, Magadheera was
      the most expensive Telugu film at the time of its release. The film's
      principal photography commenced on 19 March 2008. The film's soundtrack
      and background score were composed by M. M. Keeravani, with cinematography
      by K. K. Senthil Kumar. Action sequences were choreographed by Peter Hein
      and the duo Ram–Lakshman. Magadheera was released on 31 July 2009 to
      critical acclaim and commercial success. It became the first Telugu film
      to enter the 100 crore club, collecting a distributors' share of ₹78 crore
      and grossing ₹140 crore during its theatrical run. It became the
      highest-grossing Telugu film in history at the time. Its 1000-day
      theatrical run surpassed Chandramukhi (2005) as the longest-running South
      Indian film. The film won the National Award for Best Choreography and
      Best Special Effects at the 57th National Film Awards, along with six
      Filmfare Awards, and nine Nandi Awards. Magadheera was the first Telugu
      film to be released in the Blu-ray format in India. It was later dubbed
      into Tamil as Maveeran which earned him fanbase in Tamilnadu and Malayalam
      as Dheera: The Warrior, both released on 27 May 2011.[7] The
      Japanese-dubbed version, released in August 2018, became one of the
      highest-grossing Indian films at the Japanese box office. The film was
      remade in Odia as Megha Sabarire Asiba Pheri (2010) and in Bengali as
      Yoddha: The Warrior (2014).
